# The project consists of 2 web pages

### Page 1 - Web Automation: Poshmark Sign Up üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This will allow a user to enter their information on your website and once they click the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button, we‚Äôll automatically fill in all that information on Poshmark‚Äôs signup page: [https://poshmark.com/signup](https://poshmark.com/signup)

- Create a webpage with the following fields
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Email
    - Username
    - Password
    - Gender (same options as the ones on Poshmark)
    - Country (same options as the ones on Poshmark)
    - Signup button
- You can use React, HTML, or any other preferred way for users to enter their information visually
- No need for validating any of the user entries
- No need to copy the exact design at all since we‚Äôre assessing web automation
- Once the user fill in all the fields, they can now click the ‚Äúsignup button‚Äù and we‚Äôll automatically open a new tab and fill in the information exactly the way they entered it
- Feel free to either use a Chrome Extension or any of your favorite automation frameworks to complete filling in the user information and hitting the ‚Äúnext‚Äù button on Poshmark‚Äôs signup page
- Poshmark will not allow you to sign up from outside the US, so you can consider the challenge done as long as you hit the ‚Äúnext‚Äù button on their page

### Page 2 - Web Scraping: Poshmark User Info üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This page will only have 1 textfield that accepts a Poshmark formatted profile URL

Examples:

[https://www.poshmark.com/closet/mollyskloset](https://www.poshmark.com/closet/mollyskloset)

[https://poshmark.com/closet/jasminecolon28](https://poshmark.com/closet/jasminecolon28)

[https://posh.mk/LEbccDYnA7](https://posh.mk/LEbccDYnA7)

- The user will paste their Poshmark profile in it and hit the ‚ÄúGet info‚Äù button.
- Your job is to scrape their profile information from Poshmark any way you like (using a Chrome Extension for example, or any other preferred method) and then you‚Äôll display the following information on your web page:
    - Name
    - Number of listings
    - Profile pic (load the photo)

- Make sure to validate the Poshmark URL before attempting to scrape the data
- Don‚Äôt spend time on UI, it‚Äôs more important to retrieve the data that how you display it for now
